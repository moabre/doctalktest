# What to do

- [ ] Write get array of users on page load
- [ ] render the list of users with the UserCard and Address components
  - [ ] Should the Address Component be a child of the UserCard?
- [ ] Write A searchbar component that fileters the list of users by name
- [ ] How would reorganize this? put into files and folders? Documenting? Typescript?
- [ ] Style the UserCard however you like
  - [ ] As seen here; show vercel link.

## Bonus

- [ ] Write a component that displays the number of times we fetched the data (right beside the search bar) (should be 1)
  - [ ] then refetch the data every 5 seconds
  - [ ] While we are refetching, display a loading spinner
- [ ] send email onclick email
